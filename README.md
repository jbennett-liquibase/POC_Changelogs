This repository contains sample changelogs organized by object type and release.

The initial changesets were built using the [Adventure Works Database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver16&tabs=ssms) provided by Microsoft for SQL Server.

While the structure of the files is correct the changelogs will not run as-is due to missing dependencies.

Best practices for changelog management can be found [here](https://docs.liquibase.com/concepts/bestpractices.html).
